\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

A strong \textcolor{teal}{\textit{Conclusion}} typically encompasses several essential elements. It begins with a restatement of the thesis or main idea, reinforcing the core message of the paper. This is followed by a summary of the key points discussed throughout the text, which helps to consolidate the main arguments. The conclusion should also include final thoughts or reflections on the topic, providing a thoughtful discussion wrap-up. \cite{fellows_research_2021}
